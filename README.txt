Python script automatically uploads the latest verison of my resume to Linkedln and Handshake 
while simultaneously deleting the old verison of my resume. My passwords are omitted for 
obvious reasons and this script only works on my laptop since it makes use of
the particular screen dimensions of my laptop.
